```javascript
// Example: Growth strategy calculation
const calculateGrowthStrategy = (currentMetrics, targets) => {
  const strategies = [];
  
  if (currentMetrics.revenue < targets.revenue * 0.8) {
    strategies.push('revenue_optimization');
  }
  
  if (currentMetrics.customerAcquisitionCost > targets.cac * 1.2) {
    strategies.push('acquisition_efficiency');
  }
  
  if (currentMetrics.churnRate > 0.05) {
    strategies.push('retention_improvement');
  }
  
  return strategies;
};

// Usage
const metrics = { revenue: 500000, customerAcquisitionCost: 150, churnRate: 0.08 };
const targets = { revenue: 750000, cac: 120 };
const recommendedStrategies = calculateGrowthStrategy(metrics, targets);
console.log('Recommended strategies:', recommendedStrategies);
