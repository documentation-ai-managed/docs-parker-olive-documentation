import pandas as pd

def optimize_inventory(current_stock, demand_forecast):
    optimal_levels = {}
    for item in current_stock:
        safety_stock = demand_forecast[item] * 0.1
        reorder_point = demand_forecast[item] * 1.5
        optimal_levels[item] = max(current_stock[item], reorder_point + safety_stock)
    return optimal_levels

# Usage
forecast = {'widget_a': 100, 'widget_b': 50}
stock = {'widget_a': 75, 'widget_b': 60}
optimized = optimize_inventory(stock, forecast)
print(optimized)
